# Parallel Mean Reversion Trading Strategy

This project will implement three versions of mean reversion trading algorithm
in C++. The most basic one is a simple sequential implementation. The others
are implemented with OpenMP and CUDA, respectively. The purpose of the project
is to evaluate the performance of the same algorithm under different parallel
techniques.
